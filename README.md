# Nashville Real Estate Property Estimate 
 In this dataset, a company is trying to understand the real estate market of Nashville before making some investments. Real estate markets are always a subject of study since they give a huge return on investments. We as analysts are trying to understand various aspects that can affect the price of real estate, for instance, the year it was built, commercial plot, land size, type of flooring, etc. (Bukovac, 2022) Specifically for this project, we are trying if a property was undervalued or sold over its value.
